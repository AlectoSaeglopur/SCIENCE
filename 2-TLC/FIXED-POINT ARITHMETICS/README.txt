"dspic33ch_fixed_point_iir.png" is an oscilloscope screenshot showing the outcome of the dsPIC33CH MCU filtering in fixed-point arithmetics. In particular, the green curve is the square wave (at 500 Hz) generated by the signal generator and given as input to the MCU ADC, whereas the blue curve is the MCU DAC output signal after low-pass filtering (to keep only the fundamental tone at 500 Hz).
