1. test_srrc_filter.grc :

* To display the behavior of a short (thus not continuous/endless) symbol stream (in particular at its beginning and end), disable "Repeat" in Random Source, reduce the symbol rate (so to make the graphic update rate slower, e.g. setting Rs = 400 S/s in order to get Fs = 3.2 kSa/s assuming sps = 8) and after running the flowgraph just click "Stop" to check the waveform.

* The Throttle block shall be placed after the SRRC filter if it's value represents the actual sample rate. Otherwise, it could have been placed
after the PSK mapper, but using as value symb_rate (and not samp_rate).

* Expectedbandwidth = Rs*(1+beta) : e.g. for Rs = 500 S/s and beta = 0.5, BW = 750 Hz (i.e. between +/- 375 Hz).



2. test_epy_block.grc :

* To test the print-to-bin mode, set "No GUI / Run to completion" option, disable "Repeat" field in Vector Source, disable GUI Time Sink and enable Fuile Sink.

* To enable the graphic mode, set "QT GUI" option, enable "Repeat" field in Vector Source, enable GUI Time Sink, and disable File Sink.
