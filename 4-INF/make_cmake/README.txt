x3 ways to build a C project using:
- standalone "make" (v1 or v2), acting on related "Makefiles";
- "make" driven by "cmake", acting on "CMakeLists.txt".

Starting from the .h and .c files the scripts generate:
- compiled preprocessor outputs (.i);
- compiled assembly files (.s);
- compiled object files (.o);
- linked map file (.map);
- linked executable (.exe).s
