0. Glob patterns (aka globbing) specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters (e.g. * or |).

1. Example to print on shell and detect input from keyboard.

2. Example to save all commad history into a text file: type "history -w NAME.txt".

3. Example of how to use the "cat" (aka concatenate) command to read data from files and send the content to shell or another file. For example, type "cat ex3_text_orig.txt" to print on shell the content of that file; or "cat ex3_text_orig.txt | sort > ex3_text_sort.txt" to read the content of cat ex3_text_orig.txt, sort its content line by line in alphabetical order, and write the output into file ex3_text_ort.txt. Note the pipe character/operator (i.e. |) is used in case multiple commands are specified in the same line to specify that the output of one command serves as input to the next one.
